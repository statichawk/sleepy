### **The moment you have been waiting for is finally here!**

Starting now the @Sleepy#5718 bot is up and running! Auto disconnect yourself after a set period of time with the all new ***SLASH COMMANDS***
But what is a "slash command" you might ask?
Well! Discord is doing away with prefix commands like "!tt" or "!help" And this is a  _new era_

### ___Here's how it works___
Step 1: Type `/sleepcall` and then click on the `/sleepcall` command that appears above the message bar

Step 2: Type the number of minutes or hours you want to wait (i.e. 1-100). *This should be a number only*

Step 3: Hit tab (or tap on the next option) and choose either `Hours` or `Minutes`

Step 4: If the command looks good, hit enter and @Sleepy#5718 will respond with the confirmation!

***ITS THAT EASY!***
Common Times: 

30 Minutes `/sleepcall 30 m`

1 Hour `/sleepcall 1 h`

1.5 Hours `/sleepcall 90 m`

2 hours `/sleepcall 2 h`
